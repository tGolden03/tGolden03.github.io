            <h2>Who is Honebadger Publishing?</h2>
            <p>
                We at Honeybadger Publishing are people who love books. 
                It was started by a group of small aurthors that wanted to self publish but didn't have the resorces to do so.
                Parntering with a small time printer we were able to get our books made and out there.
                Since then other small time aurthors have come to us asking for how we did it so we decided to help mak things easy and created Honeybadger Publishing.
